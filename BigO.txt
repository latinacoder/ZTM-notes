#any coder, given enough time can solve a problem. Big O can help us distinguish bad code from great code. 

Good Code: 
1. Readable: is it generally clean? can others understand your code? 
2. Scalable: Big O notation allow us to measure code that can scale. How long an algorithm takes to run. Which one is better than the other when it comes to scale.

Calculate how many operations it takes in a function.
